BouncedMailHandler
potatoDie 2011

A simple class to parse (and to some extent handle) bounced mails.
It checks the body of the mail, to parse the mailaddress of the recipient.
It helps you to show the addresses which failed, after which a administrator might check the address and delete the mail.

I'd like an expert in mailaddresses and regular expressions to improve the parsing function. For instance, at the moment an address like <a@b.nl> is not found (because of the brackets).
